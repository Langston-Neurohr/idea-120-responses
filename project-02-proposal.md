For my green screen project I will make the background environment for my zoom I will have a door in the background that will open periodically. When the door opens a new scene will be behind the door each time for the minute long video, displaying different scenes and environments from the outside world and possibly even fantasy realms.

Jared's reply:
Love this idea, Langston. There are interesting layers here and you find yourself somewhere in the middle of them. There's us as the viewer, looking at you in the foreground in your square video on Zoom, a door in the background (in an as yet unnamed room - is it your room? an animated room? the room of a house or building completely unrelated?), then the door opens and there's another fantasy or surreal scene behind. Is there any interplay between you and these different environments? Any performative aspect during your presentation? There doesn't have to be, but it would be an option and might carry us somewhat to those other locations that are being suggested in the opening and closing door. I'm getting some Narnia vibes from this. If you haven't look at our Premiere tutorial from the other day, definitely check it out for an overview of compositing and layering video/keying out backgrounds https://vimeo.com/466053325/2d5c5ee0ab, and then check out the Photoshop tutorial (https://vimeo.com/469623026/c0871dccff) which explains how to cut out images to use in layering videos and images together in Premiere. Let me know if you have questions, either in email or on Tuesday during our worktime.
